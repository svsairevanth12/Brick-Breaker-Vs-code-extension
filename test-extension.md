# Testing the Brick Breaker Extension

## How to Test

1. Open this project in VS Code
2. Press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host
3. In the new VS Code window, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
4. Type "Open Brick Breaker Game" and select the command
5. The game should open in a new panel

## Current Features Implemented

✅ **Basic Extension Structure**
- Package.json manifest
- TypeScript compilation
- Extension activation and commands

✅ **Game Canvas and Rendering**
- HTML5 Canvas setup
- Game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- Basic rendering system

✅ **Paddle Object and Controls**
- Mouse movement control
- Keyboard arrow key control
- Boundary collision detection

✅ **Ball Object and Physics**
- Ball movement and physics
- Wall bouncing
- Paddle collision with angle calculation
- Ball attachment/launch system

✅ **Brick System**
- Colorful bricks with different hit points
- Level generation with patterns
- Brick rendering with visual feedback

✅ **Collision Detection**
- Ball-brick collision with proper bounce direction
- Brick destruction and scoring
- Level completion detection

## Controls

- **Mouse**: Move paddle left/right
- **Click or Spacebar**: Launch the ball
- **Arrow Keys**: Alternative paddle movement

## Next Steps

The core game mechanics are now working! The remaining tasks will add:
- Game state management (pause, game over)
- Power-up system (laser, multi-ball, etc.)
- Advanced features (moving bricks, difficulty scaling)
- UI polish and effects
