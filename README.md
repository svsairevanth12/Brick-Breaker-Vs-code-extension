## 🎯 Game Tips

1. **Paddle Positioning**: Keep the paddle centered for better ball control
2. **Power-Up Strategy**: Prioritize Expand and Laser power-ups for easier gameplay
3. **Speed Management**: Use Slow Ball power-up when the game gets too fast
4. **Level Strategy**: Focus on destroying regular bricks first, leave indestructible blocks
5. **Angle Control**: Hit the ball with different parts of the paddle to control bounce angle
